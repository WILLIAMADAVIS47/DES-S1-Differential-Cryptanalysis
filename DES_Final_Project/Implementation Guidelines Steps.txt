The implementation for this project is in sbox_diff_demo.py. It includes:

The exact DES S1 lookup table

Functions to run the differential experiment

A small key-space reduction demo that tests all 64 6-bit S1 subkeys and ranks them based on how well they match the dominant differential

How to run the differential part

Install Python 3

Set delta_in inside main() to the input difference you want:

# ΔX = 1
delta_in = 0b000001

# ΔX = 2
delta_in = 0b000010


Ensure trials are set to 20,000:

num_trials = 20000


Run the script:

python sbox_diff_demo.py


This prints the ΔY distribution.

How to run the key-space demo

The script automatically runs it after the differential section.
It prints the randomly chosen true 6-bit key and ranks all 64 key guesses by score.

How I produced the data files

For each ΔX (1 and 2), I ran the script twice with 20,000 trials and saved the outputs:

python sbox_diff_demo.py > results_delta_1_run1.txt
python sbox_diff_demo.py > results_delta_1_run2.txt

These files were averaged to create the tables in my results section.
